# Calculator-using-Seq2Seq-model

This is a simple tutorial where a seq2seq model is implemented in tensorflow for the purpose of computing simple arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction and multiplication. That is, feeding into a model, a sequence like "2+5" and getting an output, a sequence "7".

Examples:

- Input string: **'768`*`375'**
 Output string **'288000'**

- Input string: **'629`+`974'** 
 Output string: **'1603'**

- Input string: **'284`-`70'**
 Output string: **'214'**

For details, refer the document [Arithmetic_calculations.md](https://github.com/Vishwa22/Calculator-using-Seq2Seq-model/blob/master/Arithmetic_calculations.md)  and

For implementation, refer the IPython Notebook [Arithmetic_calculations.ipynb](https://github.com/Vishwa22/Calculator-using-Seq2Seq-model/blob/master/Arithmetic_calculations.ipynb)
